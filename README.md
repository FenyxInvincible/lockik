This add-on initially was designed for cases when there's a pre-existing animation, such as one from Mixamo, and there's a need to adjust the pose. 
The LockIK add-on allows the swift creation of Inverse Kinematic constraints and adds a target to lock bones to a specific position. 
For each locked bone, the add-on adds only one constraint and one additional helper bone. 
Upon 'Baking', these extra elements are removed, ensuring that the armature retains only the desired adjustments. 
Unlike simply applying the constraint, this add-on allows you to see the exact final result throughout the process, which makes adjusting poses more intuitive and precise.
